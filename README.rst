js.uploadify
************

Introduction
============

This library packages `uplodify File Upload`_ for `fanstatic`_. Note that
due to licensing constraints we can only provide the flash version.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`uplodify File Upload`: http://www.uploadify.com

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.uploadify``) are published to some URL.
